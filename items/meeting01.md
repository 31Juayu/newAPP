## Conflict resolution Protocol

 1. Conflict and Problem Definition
  In this Agreement, conflicts and issues mainly include but are not limited to:

- Members fail to complete tasks on time or meet the project's initial plan requirements.
- There are disagreements within the team or difficulty in reaching consensus on decisions.
- Members are temporarily unable to participate in project work due to illness or other personal reasons.

 2. Precautions
   To minimize conflicts and problems, teams should take the following precautions:

Clear allocation of roles and responsibilities: At the beginning of the project, define the roles and responsibilities of each member in detail.

Regular progress checks and meetings: Set regular meeting time points to check project progress and discover and solve problems in a timely manner.

Transparent communication channels: Establish an open and transparent communication platform to ensure instant sharing of information.

 3. Solution
- a. Task delays and unfinished tasks
Preliminary warning: The project leader should communicate with relevant members at the early stage of discovering task delays to understand the reasons and provide necessary support.

Develop remediation measures: If delays affect the project schedule, work with the member to develop a specific remediation plan and set a new deadline.

Team Assistance: If personal issues prevent completion of a task, the team should consider reassigning some work to reduce stress and maintain project progress.

- b. Decision-making conflicts
Discussion Meeting: For decision-making conflicts, hold a dedicated meeting to discuss all relevant points and each member should have the opportunity to express his or her opinion.

Voting system: If it is still difficult to reach an agreement after discussion, the decision will be made by voting (when voting, make sure that all members understand the consequences of all options).

The project leader has the final decision-making power: If the decision cannot be resolved through voting, the project leader will make the final decision based on the overall situation of the project.

- c. Member absent due to illness

Prompt notification: Once a member is unable to work due to illness, the project leader and team should be notified as soon as possible.
Temporary adjustment: The project leader will arrange for other members to temporarily take over their tasks based on the situation and the members' status.

Resources and support: The team should provide necessary support, such as adjusting project schedules and reducing the workload of sick members.

 4. Recording and Review
   Document conflicts and resolution processes: All conflict incidents and results should be documented in detail in the project log for future review and evaluation.
